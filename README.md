PingCheck Utility


The purpose of this utility is to test ICMP reachability, alert if its down and
run a configuration change. On recovery run another list of config changes specified in a recovery file.

The failure is a logical 'OR'. Therefore, if you have two IP Hosts listed, both of them need to fail in order
for a config change to be triggered. Same situation if you have 3 IP hosts listed, in that all 3 will have to fail
in order for a configuration change to be triggered.

This extension is similar to TCPCheck found here: https://github.com/arista-eosext/TCPCheck but PingCheck uses ICMP
instead of HTTP.

To use PingCheck, after installing, add the following configuration snippets to change the default behavior.  


```
daemon PingCheck
   exec /usr/local/bin/PingCheck 
   option CHECKINTERVAL value 10
   option CONF_FAIL value /mnt/flash/failed.conf
   option CONF_RECOVER value /mnt/flash/recover.conf
   option HOLDDOWN value 2
   option IPv4 value 10.1.1.2,10.1.1.6
   option PINGCOUNT value 3
   option SOURCE value lo0
   no shutdown
```

```
Config Option explanation:
- CHECKINTERVAL is the time in seconds to check hosts. Default is 5 seconds.
    - IPv4 is the address(s) to check. Mandatory parameter. Multiple addresses are comma separated.
    - CONF_FAIL is the config file to apply the snippets of config changes. Mandatory parameter.
    - CONF_RECOVER is the config file to apply the snippets of config changes after recovery of Neighbor. Mandatory parameter. 
    - PINGCOUNT is the number of ICMP Ping Request messages to send on each iteration. Default is 2.
    - HOLDDOWN is the number of iterations to wait before declaring all hosts up or down. Default is 1
      which means take immediate action. If CHECKINTERVAL is 10seconds and HOLDDOWN is 3, PingCheck will take action in 30seconds.
    - SOURCE is the source interface (as instantiated to the kernel) to generate the pings from.
      This is optional. Default is to use RIB/FIB route to determine which interface to use as source. Use interface names as 
      shown with 'bash ifconfig'  
```

The CONF_FAIL and CONF_RECOVER files are just a list of commands to run at failure or at recovery. These commands
must be full commands just as if you were configuration the switch from the CLI.

For example the above referenced /mnt/flash/failed.conf file could include the following commands, which would
shutdown the BGP neighbor on failure:

```
router bgp 65001.65500
neighbor 10.1.1.1 shutdown
```

The recover.conf file would do the opposite and remove the shutdown statement:

```
router bgp 65001.65500
no neighbor 10.1.1.1 shutdown
```

This is of course just an example, and your use case would determine what config changes you'd make.

Please note, this uses the EOS SDK eAPI interaction module. You do not need to specify 'enable' and 'configure' in your 
configuration files, because it automatically goes into configuration mode.

Additional dependencies and caveats:
* This requires EOS SDK.
* All new EOS releases include the SDK.
* Tested on EOS release 4.21.1F
* VRFs are not supported in this release.

# INSTALLATION:
Because newer releases of EOS require a SysdbMountProfile, you'll need two files - PingCheck.py and PingCheck.sysdb
PingCheck.py will need to go to an appropriate location such as /mnt/flash and PingCheck.sysdb will need to be placed in 
/usr/lib/SysdbMountProfiles. The mount profile file name MUST match the python file name. In other words, if 
you place the mount profile PingCheck in /usr/lib/SysdbMountProfiles as PingCheck, then the executable filename PingCheck.py 
must be changed to PingCheck. The filename (agent name) and mount profile name must be the same.

An RPM has been included that allows you to easily just install PingCheck as an extension and it takes care of all
the file requirements. The RPM also installs the PingCheck SDK app in /usr/local/bin. This is the preferred distribution 
method for this application.

This release has been tested on EOS 4.21.1F.
